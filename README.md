# Airnews

Airnews is a web app that allows users to scroll through news headlines with the options of liking it or adding your own article. The headlines generated is determined by the articles you have previously liked. It will generate the most similar article it can find. 

Due to time constraints of a hackathon, we used a dummy database of headlines and articles.
